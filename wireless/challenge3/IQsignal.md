 # IQ signals
A complex signal can be represented as i(t) + jq(t) where i(t) is called the in phase signal and q(t) is called the quadrature signal. The quadrature signal is out of phase to the in phase signal by 90 degrees. Both these signals have same frequency and are periodical and they can only be amplitude modulated. Conventionally the in phase signal is taken to be a cosine wave and the quadrature is taken to be a sine wave since a sine wave leads a cosine wave by 90 degrees. Similarly a modulated wave can be expressed as the sum of i(t) and q(t). The amplitude of one of these signals can be varied and added to the other signal to get a phase modulated signal. The amplitude of both the inphase and quadrature signals can be varied equally and added to get an amplitude modulated signal.
